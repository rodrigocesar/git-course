In response to your advertisement on the Data Scientist position, I am writing to outline my experience and the ways in which I could contribute to the further success of your operations.  For the last 9 years, I have been working with mathematical modeling and analysis with a focus on optimization, machine learning and statistics. My academic experience helped me to develop a strong mathematical background and my research work taught me to how to persevere when dealing with a challenging problem so that a new solution could be created. My professional experience helped me to improve my communication skills by both working with teams and providing training. 

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures (such as "variation" among and between groups), developed by statistician and evolutionary biologist Ronald Fisher. In the ANOVA setting, the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test to more than two groups. ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for statistical significance. It is conceptually similar to multiple two-sample t-tests, but is more conservative (results in less type I error) and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.
